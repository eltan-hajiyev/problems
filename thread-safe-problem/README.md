Custom validation:
[NumberConstraintValidator](src/main/java/com/github/elten400/tutorials/threadsafeproblem/validation/NumberConstraintValidator.java).

Controller class with our custom validation:
[ApiController](src/main/java/com/github/elten400/tutorials/threadsafeproblem/controller/ApiController.java)

Unit test proves that: When you attack servis with mixed right (great than 30) and wrong numbers (less than 30), sometimes it's accepting wrong numbers.
